abstract = {This paper presents Ecolinguistics as a relatively new branch of linguistics concerned with the interaction between human being and nature; how they influence each other. It handles systemic functional linguistics, usually referred to as (SFL) presented by M K Halliday, a new approach to grammar and to Ecolinguistics as well. Transitivity, as an important aspect of SFL, is applied to an article about climate change in Egypt. The six processes, participants and circumstances are analyzed as important parts of transitivity in this article.  },

abstract = {Leslie Marmon Silko was born in Albuquerque in 1948 and grew up at the Pueblo of Laguna. As a person of mixed ancestry and heritage, she felt a sense of strangeness to both the Laguna community as well as to the outside world. Profiting from her internal cultural differences and calling up the richness of her mixed heritage, Silko forges a meeting point between very different cultural traditions. Exploring the differences and similarities between Native and non-Native ways of being in the world, Silko's work can be said to enter a dialogue between cultures, in which cultural exchange as well as resistance against cultural hegemony are equally appreciated. The ongoing negotiation and communication of cultural difference that is mirrored in Silko's writings will be investigated in her lyrical historical novel Gardens in the Dunes (1999). To help focus my discussion, I will mainly concentrate on the religious aspect of cultural difference negotiated in her novel. In the theoretical section, two ways of thinking about cultural difference will first be contrasted: Structuralist Ferdinand de Saussure's theory on language, according to which meaning arises through binary oppositions and which can be said to have laid the foundation for the binary classificatory system in cultural studies, versus Mikhail Bakhtin's theory on cultural identity formation as a dialogic exchange. Various literary critic's application of Bakhtin's cultural model on Native American literature will then be discussed. The second part of this paper will be fully dedicated to the analysis of Silko's novel. With the example of the Ghost Dance, Silko's ambivalence between dialogic exchange and Native resistancewill be introduced. After a brief description of the historical ceremony, Silko's use of the Ghost Dance motif in Gardens will be investigated. Moreover, the Ghost Dance's dialogic function of uniting people across cultural boundaries and the retaking of the land and the peaceful nature of the struggle against Euro-American dominance will then be highlighted and parallels between American Indian and old European traditions will be established. For the close reading of Gardens, Edward Huffstetler's stimulating essay on “Spirit Armies and Ghost Dancers: The Dialogic Nature of American Indian Resistance” will serve as a starting point. As there have been very few published critical essays on Gardens, I will mainly rely on the text itself as well as on Ellen L. Arnold's excellent interview collection Conversations with Leslie Marmon Silko. Moreover, Silko's collected essays in Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit will also be consulted at times.},

This work shows the anarchistic atmosphere where the Germanic society lived in, that society loved invasion, fight and gaining more lands. The scarcity of researches in this topic was my passion to start my research which is discussing the conflict between a father and his son who met on the border. When the father tried to convince his son that he is his father but his son insisted on not convincing and accused his father with cowardice. This action led this father to kill his son which declared that instinct of invasion and fight can defeat blood’s consanguinity.},

abstract = {On Stefan Zweig's pluralistic language concept and his descriptive irony in the "Chess Novel" This work is the announced second supplement to my comments on Stefan Zweig's pluralistic language concept. In the first supplement, I dealt with the neologisms used by Zweig in the chess novel, which were verified using Viktor Klemperer's book LTI, Notebook of a Philologist. In order to complete the pluralistic aspect in Stefan Zweig's chess novel, a third supplement will be necessary after this second one, which will end my work on the chess novel. This second supplement is intended to attempt to get closer to Stefan Zweig's pluralistic language concept. For this purpose, the influence of the Upper German literary language and the Saxon Meissen Chancellery language on the language of the chess novel will be examined. Stefan Zweig's textual references are shaped by his time in the war archive after 1914, when he had access to documents from previous centuries. As a result, he was able to expand his knowledge to include partially unknown historical relationships. For this reason, the historical context and its meaning are to be examined in this work. The dualism between the Upper German literary language and the Saxon Meissen language in Austria is to be highlighted using a few examples from the chess novel in order to then examine the textual references. But increased attention should also be paid to the language development of naturalism. Due to the unusually long period of peace in the Belle Époque, the artists had time to search for new forms of expression, as the attitudes of people in this liberal era accepted new forms of the arts. Using a few examples, it should be found out whether the nature observations described in the chess amendment are merely a common naturalistic stylistic device. The aim of this work is to investigate whether these descriptions of nature also offer access to his presumed ambiguity within the branch's pluralistic language concept. There are typical Austrian terms that are referred to as Austriazisms. These terms are often interpreted outside Austria as a dialect. However, Austriazisms are not linguistic mutations, but common words that have a specific meaning and are based on a long cultural tradition. So they are part of Zweig's geographical expression, which has shaped him since his childhood in Vienna. In the chess novel some Austriazisms are to be highlighted in this work and the question is to be examined whether these Austriazisms are phraseologisms of the "phonographic method". It is known from the biography of Stefan Zweig that he discovered his Jewish ancestry late. During his first exile in Switzerland in 1916, Stefan Zweig started Jeremiah's drama. It was published in 1917 and premiered in Zurich in 1918. Later, under the influence of Austro and growing Nazi fascism, Zweig published his second religious drama The Buried Candlestick in 1937, in which he grappled with religious wisdom teachings, as well as with the methods of the retreat. The reader will also find this knowledge in the chess novel. The well-founded knowledge of the wisdom teachings, which Stefan Zweig quoted in the chess novel, is to be examined in this work and an answer to the question will be attempted if these quotations could possibly be meant ambiguously and thus offer access to his presumed ambiguity. The description of historical lists and their correlations, which the reader finds in the chess novel, should be checked for their relevance, since the names listed are all too obviously lexicological. The aim is to research the poetic intent within the branch's pluralistic language concept. In addition, it should be asked whether the description of the historical context offers access to his presumed ambiguity.},

Zu Beginn meines Aufsatzes möchte ich eine kurze historische Beschreibung des frühen Studiums der Tonverschiebungen geben, die hauptsächlich von Jacobs Pionierarbeit auf dem Gebiet der Philologie gefunden wurde, und außerdem werde ich die Tonverschiebungen im Allgemeinen beschreiben. Da die Begriffe First und Second Sound Shift zu der Vermutung führen, dass zwischen diesen beiden Phänomenen der Klangveränderung eine direkte Verbindung besteht, wird die Methodik der Darstellung und Beschreibung einer betreffenden Lautverschiebung mit einer hohen Ähnlichkeit zur anderen angewandt. Die systematische, germanische Linguistik mit einem kritisch suchenden und historisch vergleichenden Aspekt entwickelte sich zu Beginn des 19. Jahrhunderts. Grund dafür war die Besetzung der deutschen Länder durch Napoleon I. und die daraus resultierende allumfassende Rückkehr der Underdogs zur Geschichte und den Werten der deutschen Nation.},

It deals with the difficulties that foreign learners encounter when learning verbs with fixed prepositions, which are often associated with these verbs. Research is therefore trying to find some solutions to the problems associated with teaching, understanding and using verbs related to prepositions, for example, a translation of these verbs into Arabic with an illustration of an example in German by specifically dividing verbs into nine types of groups. Because each group illuminates the type of recession of the preposition and the direction of the verb and whether the verb demands a direct or indirect object or whether it does not govern an object and is limited to the accompanying preposition. In particular, the German grammar books did not highlight or present such subdivisions or classifications to the Arab student},
